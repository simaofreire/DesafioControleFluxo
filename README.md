## Getting Started

The `Contador` class is the entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the `RegrasDeNegocio` class and calls its methods to obtain parameters, count numbers, and perform new operations.

The `RegrasDeNegocio` class is responsible for obtaining parameters from the user, performing a counting operation based on the parameters, and allowing the user to perform multiple operations if desired. It also handles exceptions for invalid input.

The `ParametrosInvalidosException` class is a custom exception class that extends the Exception class in Java. It is used to handle and throw exceptions related to invalid parameters.
